* Eventually, a model by Dr. Avigdor Eldar based on Cz치r치n's work.
** There should be two kinds of models
*** Avigdor's model
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3158151/
**** The population has two kinds of signals (S1, S2) and two kinds of receptors (R1, R2).
***** S1 affects positively R1
***** S2 affects positively R2
*** Cz치r치n's model

**** The population has one kind of signal (S) and one kind of receptor (R).
