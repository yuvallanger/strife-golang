Eventually, a model by Dr. Avigdor Eldar based on Czárán's work.
======

The great pluralism of signals in highly related gram positive bacteria was
theorized by [Avigdor et al 2011] to be the result of a ratchet mechanism.
This mechanism was tested in a simple simulation based on [Czárán 2009].
The state of the simulation is a 300 by 300 grid of cells, each cell is has two loci.
A receptor and a signal loci.
